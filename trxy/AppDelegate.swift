    // HOW THE HECK DOES ALL THIS WORK??
    // 
    // (app start with no input urls)
    // - AppDelegate::configurationForConnecting Tell the app to use scenes and to start with the "Default Confiugration" scene
    // - SceneDelegate::willConnectTo creates the DocumentBrowserViewController which will open a open file dialog
    // - When user picks a file from the open file dialog, SceneDelegate::openURLContexts will tell the DBVC to reveal the document
    // - DBVC creates the TestResultDocument which parses the file into TestResult objects
    // - DBVC spins up ListView for the TestResult objects
}
